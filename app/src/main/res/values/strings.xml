    <string name="bio">Madison Blackstone is a director of brand marketing,
        with experience managing global teams and multi-million-dollar campaigns.
        Her background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management inform
        her mindful but competitive approach. Madison is fueled by her passion for
        understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising.
        She considers herself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on her academic
        foundations in psychology and sociology and stay in tune with the latest digital
        marketing strategies through continued coursework.
        \n\nHer hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action
        has contributed to her most recent success at Rockwell Group,
        where she led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting
        brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex. Meanwhile, she vastly improved the productivity
        of her team by implementing strategic project management methods and ensuring
        a work-life balance for her department.
        \n\nMadison believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet she lives
        out through her interests in yoga, meditation, gardening, and painting. Madison
        is currently working as a freelance marketing director and is always
        interested in a challenge. Reach out to madisonblackstone@gmail.com to connect!</string>
